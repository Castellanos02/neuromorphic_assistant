This project focuses on using neuromorphic computing to create an AI-based car assistance system that is able to operate with low computation cost. With neuromorphic computing, it costs less to perform AI operations because the memory storage is integrated with processing. Our approach involves using Lava which is an open-source software framework to create a spiking neural network model that learns and adapts based on the user’s preferences. The model will help select the best suggestion for the user based on the context data while keeping a low computational cost.
